## Hi, I'm Andrea 🌷

I'm a twenty-something currently based in Madrid, though I’m often wandering through other corners of the world. I created this space to share stories through photographs—moments that moved me, scenes that stayed with me. I hope you find something here that inspires you or simply entertains you.

Beyond travel and photography, I work as a **Machine Learning Engineer and Data Analyst**, with a background in **Electronics** and a Master’s in **Automation and Robotics** from the Polytechnic University of Madrid. I’m passionate about building intelligent systems, uncovering insights from data, and creating practical AI solutions that make a difference.

If you're curious about my professional work, feel free to connect with me through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreafontalvoechavez/).

Thanks for stopping by 🤍
