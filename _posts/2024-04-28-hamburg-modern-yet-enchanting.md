Hamburg is a city I keep close to my heart, since I used to visit it a lot some time ago. 
Although known as a very cold city, it’s true that It has that north European vibe to it, 
it still provides warmth in how beautiful it truly is. I think is one of the most beautiful cities in Germany, 
and I’m sure many would agree with this.

Here are some photographs that I took throughout my visits, that show juts a bit of how enchanting it is of a city.
