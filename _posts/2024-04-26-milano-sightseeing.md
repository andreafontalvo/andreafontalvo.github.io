Milan (Milano, Italia) is a classical sightseeing where I always feel comfortable taking my camera knowing that I will be capturing the most beautiful city scenes. Here are some photographs to prove it.

This city is surrounded by an aura of modern style and design, yet it still remains quite classical. With its marvelous Duomo and Galleria, to the hip area of piazza Gae Aulenti, I always find interesting scenes to capture.

Even though to some this city may be small, and apart from a couple of important landmarks, it might seem like it doesn’t offer much for sightseeing, I actually think that would be staying on the surface of it all. I think Milan is a one of a kind city where the attractions go beyond the landmarks or modern buildings. It is actually the people on the streets, the sound of the trams passing, and the overall ambiance that always makes me glad to visit this city.

I would encourage anyone that’s thinking of visiting Milan to look beyond the surface and just immerse in its streets. With a gelato on hand, of course.
